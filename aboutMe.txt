Hi!

My name is Jessica Knoblock. I am studying Aerospace Engineering and Computer Science at CU Boulder. I am very interested in software and want to become a developer. I am considering taking more time to turn my computer science minor into a double major. 

Fun fact about me: I really like panda bears. Also, I used to be an olympic weightlifter. That was cool.
